## Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning
In this Notebook, we are going to solve the Loan Approval Prediction. This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. A few examples of classification problems are Spam Email detection, Cancer detection, Sentiment Analysis, etc.

## Understanding the Problem Statement
A loan is a bank's main source of revenue. The profits earned through loans account for most of the bank's profits. Even though the bank accepts the loan following a lengthy verification and testimony process, there is no guarantee that the chosen candidate is the right one. When done manually, this operation takes a long time. We can predict whether a given hopeful is safe or not, and the entire testimonial process is automated using machine literacy. Loan Prognostic is beneficial to both bank retainers and hopefuls.

The Bank wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out online application forms. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.

As mentioned above this is a Binary Classification problem in which we need to predict our Target label which is “Loan Status”.

Loan status can have two values: Yes or No.

Yes: if the loan is approved
No: if the loan is not approved
So using the training dataset we will train our model and try to predict our target column that is “Loan Status” on the test dataset.

## The Conclusion from Model Building
Therefore, Random Forest and Logistic Regression are the best model for this prediction since their accuracy_score lies between 0.83 to 0.85. After using all these customer records, we are able to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the customers in the dataset would get loan approved or not along with that we were able to draw some insights from the data via data analysis and visualization.
